                          Many popular internet communication services have evolved over the past decade to meet new needs. Emails, social networking websites etc have undergone major evolution for their interfaces, usage, and also for how we feel about them. The landscape is changing with current users who are tech savvy, demand high quality and well designed products. However, there is one web service which has survived without having to undergo a big change: online forums. For this project, we had to decide on which community of users we would be redesigning the forums for. We talked to our users to bring in the insights. We focussed on COMPUTER IMGINATION, one of the 7 themes of good design for attempting this redesign. We also learned how to form a good argument for what we choose to do.<br>

                              <div class="projectSubHeadings">What are the problems with online forums?</div>
                              <p class="projectBodyText"> Currently online forums do not tackle a few things affectively:<br><br>
                                <b>Catching up - </b> It is not a easy task for a new user to catch up with an ongoing conversation, specially if there are a large number of participants.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Unaesthetic Design - </b> The look and feel for most of these online forums have stayed the same for a long time. It is the same plain, thread based design which can span across multiple pages for long conversations.<br><br>
                                <b>Cognitive Processing</b> - Users tend to engage in short conversations. The overwhelming text based design does scare some users away. For example, some people would not even try using reddit even though it is a good product. </b>

                                So we had an idea about the problems, the next step was to choose our group of users.

                               We chose to design for travel forums users. Travel forums have always seen a good number of users looking not only for simple answers, but sometimes also for descriptions on travel experiences with rich media. 
                              
                               We looked into <b>TripAdvisor, LonelyPlanet, TravBuddy and some subreddits: /r/travel, /r/backpacking, /r/campingandhiking etc.</b><br><br>

                               The travellers community is vast as well. We found out that the communities for backpacking and hiking were among the most active ones. This single community is still divided into multiple others (<a href="http://1source.basspro.com/index.php/component/k2/205-hiking/2606-8-types-of-hikers-which-one-are-you" class="aLinks">different kinds of hikers</a>), and this was definitely an interesting user group. 
                               <br><br>
                               We formed a survey for these travellers, and posted it on these websites/forums and blogs:<br>

                              
                                1) What got you into this (forum)?<br>
                                2) What keeps you coming back to (forum)?<br>
                                3) What do you value about the (forum) community?<br>
                                4) What would the perfect forum for you be or look like?<br><br>

                                For the moderators:<br>
                                1) Why did you want to become a moderator of (forum)?<br>
                                2) Why did you become a moderator of multiple subreddits?<br><br>
                  
                                While we were getting to know more about our users, we started sketching computer imaginative ideas.

                                  From the responses that we got from the online survey, and by talking to some backpackers/hikers about how they travel, we got to know about a few things.

                                  1) Travelers are eager to read the stories of others so that they can learn from them and improve their own travel experiences.<br>

                                  2) In turn, travelers also enjoy sharing their own experiences in order
                                  to help others.<br>

                                  3) Travel forum frequenters enjoy the community that develops when
                                  they connect with people who share their interests.
